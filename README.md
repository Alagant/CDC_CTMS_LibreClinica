# Docker System Requirements


| Application Server | Java       | Database      | 
|--------------------|------------|---------------|
| ```tomcat:7-jdk8-slim```           | ```maven:3.5.0-jdk-8``` | ```postgres:11``` |



_the real open source electronic data capture (EDC) for clinical studies._

[LibreClinica](https://libreclinica.org) is the community driven successor of OpenClinica. It is an open source clinical trial software for Electronic Data Capture (EDC) and Clinical Data Management (CDM).

### Getting Started

Check out [LibreClinica Documentation](https://libreclinica.org/documentation) to learn how to [install](https://libreclinica.org/documentation/install.html), [validate](https://libreclinica.org/documentation#Tests) and [use](https://libreclinica.org/documentation/manuals.html) the software.

#### System Requirements

These versions of required software packages are currently available in Debian 10 (Buster) Linux.

| Application Server | Java       | Database      | 
|--------------------|------------|---------------|
| Tomcat 9           | OpenJDK 11 | PostgreSQL 11 |

> **_NOTE:_** LibreClinica SOAP web API is legacy, not tested and not actively developed.

### Development

[LibreClinica Aims](https://libreclinica.org/goals.html) define main activities where community members can actively participate in the development process. In case of interest in contributing into the codebase, check out [LibreClinica Developer Documentation](https://libreclinica-docs.readthedocs.io) to learn how to [set up the development workstation](https://libreclinica-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/dev-machine.html) and understand the [branching strategy](https://libreclinica-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/developer.html) that is used to control the contribution workflows.

### Build and Deployment

#### Environment Variables

The `.env` and `.env_emails` files are environment variable files used in Docker and other development environments. They store key-value pairs that can be used to configure the application.

1. `.env`: This file contains environment variables related to the PostgreSQL database and other settings. The variables include the PostgreSQL password, user, database name, host, and port. These variables are used to configure the PostgreSQL service in the Docker Compose file.

```dotenv
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=clinica
PGPASSWORD=clinica
PG_PASSWORD=clinica
POSTGRES_USER=clinica
POSTGRES_DB=libreclinica
POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
MAILPASSWORD=your_password_here
```

2. `.env_emails`: This file contains environment variables related to email settings, such as the admin email, mail username, and developer emails. These variables are used to configure the email settings of the application.

```dotenv
ADMINEMAIL=admin@example.com
MAILUSERNAME=user@example.com
DEVELOPEREMAILS=dev1@example.com,dev2@example.com
MAILPASSWORD=your_password_here
```


#### Local Development

Here's a step-by-step guide to build and run the project:

1. **Build the Docker Images**

   You need to build the Docker images for your application and your PostgreSQL database. You can build these images using the `docker-compose build` command.

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml build
   ```

2. **Run Docker Compose**

   You can start your application using the `docker-compose up` command.

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
   ```

   This command will start all the services defined in your `docker-compose-local.yml` file. In your case, it will start your application, PostgreSQL database, and Adminer.


3. **Environment Variables**

   Your application uses environment variables which are defined in the `.env` file. Docker Compose automatically picks up these variables when you run the `docker-compose up` command.


4. **Access the Application**

   Once all the services are up and running, you can access your application at `http://localhost:8080`.


#### Production Deployment

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Docker installed on your machine.
    - Git installed on your machine.
    - Access to the project repositories on GitHub.


2. **Clone the Repositories:**
    - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
    - Run the following command to clone the LibreClinica repository:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Alagant/CDC_CTMS_LibreClinica.git
      ```
    - Run the following command to clone the Drug Management Module repository:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Alagant/libreclinica_drug_trial_module.git
      ```
    - Run the following command to clone the 0Auth Module repository:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Alagant/cdc_oauth_portal_mockup.git
      ```
    - Navigate into the cloned repository:
      ```bash
      cd CDC_CTMS_LibreClinica
      ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables:**
    - Before building the Docker image, you need to set up the environment variables. These variables are defined in the `.env` and `.env_emails` files. You can create a copy of these files and update the variables as per your requirements.
    - The `.env_emails` file should contain the following variables:
        - ADMINEMAIL: The email of the admin.
        - MAILUSERNAME: The username for the mail server.
        - DEVELOPEREMAILS: The emails of the developers.


4. **Build the Docker Image:**
    - Run the following command to build the Docker image:
      ```bash
      docker compose build --build-arg ENVIRONMENT=development --build-arg ADMIN_EMAIL=<your-email> --build-arg MAIL_USERNAME=<your-email-username> --build-arg MAIL_PASSWORD=<your-email-password> --build-arg MAIL_ERROR_MSG=<developer-emails>
      ```
    - Replace `<your-email>`, `<your-email-username>`, `<your-email-password>`, and `<developer-emails>` with your actual values.


5. **Run the Maven Install:**
    - Run the following command to execute the Maven install:
      ```bash
      docker compose run libreclinica mvn -B clean install -DskipTests
      ```

6. **Deploy the Application:**
    - Copy the built WAR file to the Docker volume for deployment:
      ```bash
      sudo cp /docker/volumes/cdc_ctms_libreclinica_libreclinica_src/_data/web/target/LibreClinica-web-1.3.1.war /docker/volumes/cdc_ctms_libreclinica_libreclinica_webapps/_data/LibreClinica.war
      ```
    - Start the Docker containers:
      ```bash
      docker compose up -d
      ```

7. **Access the Application:**
    - Once the Docker containers are up and running, you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080/LibreClinica`.
