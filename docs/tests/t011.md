# T011 subject matrix
**Abstract:**  
This documents contains the definitions for tests that target the feature 'subject matrix'.

As a result the functionality described in some of the following paragraphs should be tested using all of the following test-scenario's:  

|            | Person ID | Group A | Group B |
