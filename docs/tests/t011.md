# T011 subject matrix
**Abstract:**  
This documents contains the definitions for tests that target the feature 'subject matrix'.
The representation of the subject matrix depends on the study parameter configuration, specifically whether or not the person id and the secondary id are used and whether or not one or more groups have been defined.
As a result the functionality described in some of the following paragraphs should be tested using all of the following test-scenario's:  

|            | Person ID | Group A | Group B |  
|----------- | --------- | ------- | ------- |  
| Scenario A |           |         |         |   
| Scenario B |  x        |         |         |   
| Scenario C |           |  x      |         |   
| Scenario D |  x        |  x      |         |   
| Scenario E |           |  x      | x       |   
| Scenario F |  x        |  x      | x       |
